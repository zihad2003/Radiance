# 🎉 Skin Analysis AI - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

I have successfully added the **AI Skin Health Analyzer** to your Radiance platform! 🩺✨

---

## ✨ **What Was Built**

### **1. 🧠 Vision-Powered Backend (`convex/skinAnalysis.ts`)**
-   **Advanced Detection:** Uses **GPT-4o Vision** to clinically analyze facial photos for specific dermatological concerns.
-   **Concerns Detected:** acne, wrinkles, dark circles, and dryness.
-   **Smart Fallback:** Works instantly in "Demo Mode" (returning realistic mock data) if no API key is present.

### **2. 🩺 Diagnostic UI Component (`src/components/SkinHealthAnalyzer.jsx`)**
-   **Camera & Upload:** Users can snap a live photo or upload a high-res selfie.
-   **Client-Side Optimization:** Auto-resizes images to 512px locally to save speed and data.
-   **Visual Report:** Displays a "Health Score" dashboard with animated severity bars.
-   **Actionable Advice:** Generates a custom 4-step daily routine and recommends a specific salon service to book.

### **3. 🔗 Strategic Integration**
-   Placed prominently on the **Services Page** (`/services`).
-   Acts as a powerful **Lead Magnet**: "Get a free skin analysis, then book the treatment we recommend."
