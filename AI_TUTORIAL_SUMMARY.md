## ✨ **What Was Built**

### **1. 🧠 Intelligent Backend (`convex/tutorials.ts`)**

- **Customizable:** Takes both `topic` (the look) and `skillLevel` (Beginner/Intermediate/Pro) as inputs.

### **2. 🎨 Beautiful UI Component (`src/components/MakeupTutorialGenerator.jsx`)**
- **Interactive Input:** Users can type any look or choose from trending suggestions.
- **Timeline View:** Steps are displayed in a clear, vertical timeline format.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Automatically lists necessary products and pro tips.
- **Premium Design:** Animations, glassmorphism effects, and a polished layout matching the Radiance brand.

### **3. 🔗 Seamless Integration**
- Added to the **Virtual Try-On Page** (`/virtual-try-on`).
- Creates a complete user journey:
  1. **Analyze** Skin Tone 🔍
  2. **Try On** Virtual Looks 💄
  3. **Learn** How to Recreate It 🎓
